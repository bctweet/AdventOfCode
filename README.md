#Advent of Code
This repo houses my solutions for Advent of Code challenges!

To use, simply clone the repo and update the path to your personal input file in the file reading statement of whichever day's code you are attempting to execute.

For instance, to run on my machine, it looks like this:

'''python
day1 = open("input/day1input.txt", "r").readlines()
'''

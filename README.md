# Advent of Code
This repo houses my solutions for Advent of Code challenges!

To use, simply clone the repo and update the inputpath variable to your personal input file in the file reading statement of whichever day's code you are attempting to execute.

For instance, to run the Day 1 program on my machine, the inputpath statement looks like this:

``` python
inputpath = "input/day1input.txt"
```

Once this is done, you can run the file as you would any other python file!

For example, if I were trying to run the Day 1 program, the command would look like this:
```bash
python3 day1.py
```

And voila! You will be presented with your unique solution!
